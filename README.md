Simple project for preparing to java interview

Project based on Retype app, which is instrument for creating SSG (Static Site Generating)

For best expirience i would like to recommend to install Retype using npm:
  1. Install npm if you don't have any
  2. Install retype using 'npm install retypeapp --global'
  3. Start retype from root project directory using 'retype start'
  4. Retype will start at localhost:5000
